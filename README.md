Tilted Variational Bayes
========================

A variational method, using the 'tilted' distribution from EP as the averaging
distribution. 

Here we have implemented TVB for inference in Gaussian process classifiacation
and robust regression. 

Our paper has been accepted for publication at AISTATS. Here's the citation-to-be:
